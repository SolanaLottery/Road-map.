# Road-map.
1- Twitter account for the project. (As it turned out, it's quite difficult to get the first followers).

2- Discord server. A place where you will find out important upcoming events and discuss any news. Every day we improve the functionality of the server. Today it is intuitively clear and there are no unnecessary details. We are going to add several international chats, for the convenience of communicating in our native language, we consider this an important point.
3- Website. We are currently using a temporary site. After the first mint, we will start developing a permanent and understandable website for Solana Lottery.
4- First mint - will have 111 nft and have the value of the OG project role holder. (number of nft of this role will remain unchanged).
After minting, you will be able to sell this NFT. (but this is not the best idea, read the section about the role of the OG project.)
5- Second mint. After all the payouts to the winners, we will consider ways to collaborate with communities to promote and reach a larger audience of crypto enthusiasts and crypto lovers.
6- Collaborations and advertising.
7- Automate various processes as the Solana Lottery community grows.
8- Analytics of trends in the field of crypto-lottery and evaluation of the project rating. (there is always room to grow and develop).
9- Maintain #1 position in the crypto lottery rankings.

We have indicated only the key steps.
Time intervals are not easy to predict.
We understand that we will face certain difficulties on the way to goal #1., but they will only make us stronger.
Your support adds motivation, Solana Lottery's followers are the best.
